## What do I need:

- Train
- Station
- Accident 
- Route
- Schedule 

## How the parts are connected?

- Route == {station1, station2, ...}
	- Approximation: no train colision inside station
- Accident == singleton 
	- Generates one randomly and applies it to correct thing

## Notes

- 2 types of map generation
	- metro - style
	- railway - style 
- Resolving accidents needed

## Metro - style

- Train deep description needed
